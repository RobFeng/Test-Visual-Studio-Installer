To only install a file, if it doesn't already exist, follow these steps:
1. Add a "Search Target Machine" entry under the "Launch Conditions" view in your setup project.
2. fill in the FileName property and the Folder property.
3. the Property property should be a constant you can remember, like "B_FILE_EXISTS"
4. in the "File System" view of your project, locate the component to install and add this to the Condition property "not B_FILE_EXISTS"
